<p>Hi! I'm Dillon Dukes! This is a transcript of what I am going to say in case you are hard of hearing... Well, working with these guys has been, well interesting. I mean, Stephen seems to talk in the language of car, going on and on about weird things like forced induction, and fuel economy, and revving cold, and a car called General Lee... whatever that means. Then Aiden has been going on about the NFL draft, and the Smith-Schuster, which I guess is an event? I don't know... I'm starting to question whether or not there is a single person left on this freakin EARTH who speaks standard English. So... instead of doing the sane thing and running like heck, I tried to understand them. The results are curious. All I can say is.... good luck understanding a word of their schpeals.</p>

<p>Well, this is going to be relatively understandable. I was born in Winter of 2005, and the only one who turned out relatively sane. I have some awards under my belt, unlike Stephen *hey!*, such as People's Choice, Superindendents' List, and a bunch of other academics. I am normal! I use snapchat, I don't know what the frick a JDM rotary MX-5 Miata is, other then the fact that Stephen wants one... Me being normal, there isn't really much to tell. But, our leaders needed me to tell Stephen all this crap since HE owned the document. God, there is only so much interaction with this kid I can take. Ms. Bhavana, have mercy in the future... there is only so much Natural Aspiration or Forced Induction I can take... Anyway, my brother is a track STAR! He is amazing at all of his events. You need a record broken? Who U Gonna Call? MY BRUTHA!! My cousin sells houses, he's a real estate agent. And then there's me. I'm not particularly special, just normal. I mean, I like sports, but I'm not that good at them. I'm just average. I am a Deity at Madden and Fifa 14 and 2Kay and Call of Duty and Fallout 4 and ah, okay, enough video game garbage. I can kinda fit in anywhere. Except with petrolheads and jocks and IT guys...</p>

<p>Hey, guys! I can't freakin believe it. Dillon Dukes is legit giving me blank stares every time I talk about sports. Give me a break. Who doesn't know what lacrosse is? *DILLON AND STEPHEN IN SYNC: Me*  Whatever. Don't you at least know that the New York Lizards are the single best team in the league. Geeze. I mean, football has nothing on lacrosse. Nor does baseball, or motorsports. Lacrosse is SO much more exciting. Anyway, I gotta make this quick, I gotta bang out some push-ups. Look at these biceps. You gotta keep them in SHAPE! I was born in Summer of 2006. I have uh... no siblings. And as much intellegince as that. Ds and Fs are how I roll in school. But I kick everyone's butt in gym. Anyway, I gotta go. Sooner that weirdo Stephen is done, I get to do some pushups!</p>

<p>Hi. Uhh, so I gotta share some stuff about me. Here goes: I like Muscle Hooning, but Europe for comfort and handling. I mean, Mucle Accelerates, Europe turns, and JDM kicks out the rear. I mean, you ever heard of a RWD GTR? I'm a Stick and DCT Junkie... but I like Stick for antitheft. I'm pretty impartial to A vs M battle, though, personally believing that DCT is the best all around transmission, but that REAL PEOPLE use clutches. I like turbos over NA because TOP SPEED... come on. Throttle responce is great, but you want every horse you can from that engine on the salt flats. Sorry. Personally (there is too much here to write all of it down... sorry)</p>
